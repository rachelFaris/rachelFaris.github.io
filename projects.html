                <h2>Design-focused landing page with use of flexbox, textured background and color pallet derived
                    from hero image.</h2>
                <p>For this project, my main focus was creating visual equanimity for the overall feel of the page
                    since it's for an interior design company. I used two, contrasting background-textures,
                    kept it simple with two paired fonts ('Nunito Sans' and 'Orbitron') and used a deep gold and
                    dark brown taken from the main picture for the colors that repeat as a linear-gradient in the team
                    section.
                </p>
                <p>Flexbox was a perfect use case for this application to show the multiple categories the company has
                    to offer.
                    I applied a gentle hover effect with box-shadow and opacity to help with user-interaction.

                <p>This game was a project from my JavaScript class that I made more user-friendly by changing the flow
                    of the application, overhauling the design and modifying the way the logic works.</p>
                <p>It originally had numbers between 1 &#38; 20 and started with a positive number of attempts and
                    counted down.
                    I also added some attributes so that only numbers could be picked and stepped that were 1 through
                    10.

                </h2>
                <p>The focus for this project was to use media query brakpoints to ensure the page worked as expected
                    regardless of screen size.
                </p>
                <p>I also experimented with some different shadow effects for the hover portions of the classes section.

                <h2>JavaScript joke application using buttons to open different window modals based on which button is
                    clicked.</h2>
                <p>The challenge for this project was in getting the event handler to change what opened based on the
                    joke that was clicked.
                </p>
                <p>The background blurring effect was accomplished with an overlay and use of display and z-index.
                </p>
                <p>For the next iteration of this project, I'd like to set it up so that the asnwers show up directly on
                    top of the joke itself instead of the center of the screen.

                <p>For this project, I started with the colors, then picked the fonts based on what intuitively seemed
                    to pair well with them.
                </p>
                <p>...For some reason, the fonts and colors together reminded me of a jungle.</p>
